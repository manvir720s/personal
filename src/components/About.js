                            <p class="lead">I'm a 4th-year student pursuing a Double Degree in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo (UW)
                                and Business at Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU). My academic journey blends technical prowess and business acumen,
                                and I'm passionate about using my coding skills to craft applications that simplify daily tasks and enhance our understanding
                                of complex data. Whether it's building mobile apps for efficiency or web applications for data analysis, I derive immense
                                satisfaction from coding.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Beyond academics, I'm a sports enthusiast, often found on the basketball or volleyball court.
                                Cars fascinate me, not just as vehicles but as feats of engineering and design. In my spare time, I indulge in building mobile
                                and web apps, reading books, and occasionally testing my luck in poker. When it comes to entertainment, I have a penchant for TV shows
                                like "Billions," "South Park," and I find myself revisiting the timeless classic, "The Sopranos." I'm a well-rounded individual with
                                a passion for technology, sports, cars, literature, and the occasional card game. Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to chat
                                about coding, sports, or any of my other interestsâ€”I'm always up for a great conversation!</p>
